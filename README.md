# C-minus-minus_compiler
2016 Group project for Compilers class to create a "C--" compiler using C and MIPS Assembly Language

NOTE: During this project, we had some issues with our school's GitLab setup, and were only able to commit from one of our group members' computers (hence all commits being from one user)
