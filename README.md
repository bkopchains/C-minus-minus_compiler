# C-- Compiler
2016 Group project for Compilers class to create a "C--" compiler using C and MIPS Assembly Language

The name "C--" comes from the compiler's ability to read some code in C, however its functionality is limited, so it is labeled as "C--" and not just "C"

NOTE: During this project, we had some issues with our school's GitLab setup, and were only able to commit from one of our group members' computers (hence all commits being from one user)
